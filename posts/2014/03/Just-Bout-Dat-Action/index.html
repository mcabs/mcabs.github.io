                <p class="images"> <img src="/images/hehateme.jpg"><br>The inspiration for the name of the site
</p>

<p>This is my first mock up our new site He Hate Us. </p>
<p>What are we doing here at He Hate Us (HHU for the rest of the post)?<br />
Well, a couple of us who met at MIT doing Aerospace Engineering have kept in touch post graduation and decided that there's very little we care about more than sports, despite our current lines of work. Due to our backgrounds, we've naturally been particularly interested in the more analytical approaches to sports that have started to be a regular part of mainstream discussion. Since we talk about sports with each other all day we thought we could attempt to contribute to the sports community and thought our own site would be a good forum to do that. We recruited another one of our friends and hope to post interesting stuff about sports here.</p>
<p>What are we going to talk about?<br />
Anything that comes to mind really. We'll try and keep to sports but after spending formative intellectual years reading Bill Simmons we like the idea of throwing in pop culture references. Luckily, there's a major sport being played year round so we'll have ideas year round. We all seem to really care about roster construction and team management so we'll have a bias towards player acquistion and evaluation compared to other articles. I'll apologize now for admitted homerism that will drive some of our articles. A couple of us were born and raised in the county of Dade. The other is as Pittsburgh as it gets. We'll likely have other friends drop in and contribute because this is really a fun, passion project and anyway to expand what we're doing would please us.</p>
<p class="images"> <img src="/images/ABrown_FinalPlay.png")><br>This would have gotten too much coverage on this site</p>

<p>Who are we?<br />
Cabs - One of the aforementioned guys born and raised in Miami, I will root for any Miami team. The Dolphins and the Heat are easy bets but I have a Panthers jersey and align myself with Da U (The Marlins just exist in my memory at the moment). I went to MIT where I met George because I'm no good at doing homework. I sold out and chased the money in finance and now live in New York.<br />
George - The other guy from MIT has stayed true to actually doing something worthwhile with what he learned and is still there working on his PHD in Nuclear Engineering. He is from Pittsburgh, so I hear more about the Pirates than I ever cared to. He also has strong familial ties to Penn State.<br />
Fwank - Is also from Miami. This means we get to lament the perpetual mediocrity of the Miami Dolphins. As impressionable children, Dan Marino was the Dolphins QB and now our bar of QB acceptance is impossibly high. He is the only one of us who went to a school with a legitimate sports program (Florida) but he managed to pick up an MBA from Emory and is up in New York now in the finance industry as well.</p>
<p>That's us. We hope to entertain and maybe provide some brain food. And always, thanks for reading.</p>
